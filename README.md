**Riddle Cipher is a small interactive Caesar cipher demo.**


It lets users decrypt a hidden message by shifting an alphabet left or right until the correct solution is found.
The cipher is fully configurable directly in HTML, with support for both standard Latin and Polish alphabets.

It can be used for small surprises or riddles — for example, if a birthday gift hasn’t arrived yet, you can encode the gift’s name, share the page via a QR code, and let the recipient discover the surprise in advance.
